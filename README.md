## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/idkcallme/GhostHire.git
cd GhostHire
npm install

# Setup environment (optional - for Midnight Network)
cp app/.env.example app/.env
cp backend/env.example backend/.env

# Deploy smart contracts (optional)
cd contracts
npm run deploy

# Start the application
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:5174
```

### 🔧 Midnight Network Configuration

For full Midnight Network integration:

1. **Configure Network Settings** in `app/.env`:
   ```env
   VITE_MIDNIGHT_RPC_URL=https://rpc.midnight.network
   VITE_MIDNIGHT_PROOF_PROVIDER_URL=https://proof-provider.midnight.network
   VITE_MIDNIGHT_NETWORK_ID=midnight-devnet
   ```

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npm run compile  # Compile Compact contracts
   npm run deploy   # Deploy to Midnight Network
   ```

3. **Start with Midnight Integration**:
   ```bash
